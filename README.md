Non-Mediated Governance stands for a vision where the core paradigm of governance is changed from a serviced/mediated model in which officials issue documents to assert one's rights into a model in which one's rights are determined by querying an online information system. This would result in a network of rights - a digital fabric - that would hold massive amounts of data, with detailed descriptions of the (legally relevant) relations that make up the public apparatus.
